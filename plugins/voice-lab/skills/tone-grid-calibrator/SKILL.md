# Tone Grid Calibrator

## Purpose

Map writing tone on the Tone Grid framework, locating writer position between loose/tight and irreverent/professional axes. Identifies quadrant position and tone aspirations.

## Framework Reference

**Two axes:**
- **Feel** (X): Loose (1) to Tight (10) — how structured is your copy?
- **Attitude** (Y): Irreverent (1) to Professional (10) — how buttoned-up are you?

**Four quadrants:**
- Loose + Irreverent = **Playful** (David Sedaris)
- Loose + Professional = **Laid Back** (Basecamp)
- Tight + Irreverent = **Snappy/Punchy** (Apple ads)
- Tight + Professional = **Polished** (Malcolm Gladwell)

## Flow

1. Read writing samples from `training/voice/` — use any `.md` files present as the sample set
2. If no samples: "I need to read your writing to figure out where you sit on the grid. Paste something?"
3. Analyze the Feel axis: "How tight is your writing? Is every sentence engineered, or does it flow conversationally?" Rate 1-10 with evidence.
4. Analyze the Attitude axis: "How irreverent are you? Full snark, or buttoned-up professional?" Rate 1-10 with evidence.
5. Plot the position and identify the quadrant
6. Present with comparisons: "You're sitting at about (Feel: 3, Attitude: 6) — that's Laid Back territory. Think Basecamp's copy. Conversational but credible. Like a smart friend giving advice."
7. Ask: "Does that feel right? Sometimes people want to BE somewhere different from where they naturally land."
8. On approval, save to `training/voice/analysis/tone-grid.md`
9. Update `.coworker/index.md` with a note that tone grid analysis exists.

## Rules

- Always show your reasoning with actual text examples
- Feel axis: 1 = stream of consciousness, 10 = every word deliberate
- Attitude axis: 1 = all snark and zero corporate, 10 = boardroom-appropriate
- Position is descriptive (where you ARE), but also ask about aspiration (where you WANT to be)
- Use well-known comparisons they'll recognize — not obscure writers
- If they're in the Neutral Zone (4-6 on both), gently note it: "You're in the middle right now — which is fine, but the most memorable writers pick a corner."
